# Morse-bit
StudentHack VII Submission, won Most Retro Hack 2019

Morse:bit provides users with the ability to communicate with other micro:bit's using radio signals. A user may input a message in Morse code and it will be transmitted to all nearby micro:bit's as text. Each micro:bit will relay any received messages to increase the potential transmission range.

## Usage
Encode the minified file, morsebit_min.py, into hex and then copy the file onto your morse bit or flash it. This can be done on the [online micro:bit editor](https://python.microbit.org/v/1.1). It can also be done in [Mu](https://codewith.mu/), or [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) using the MicroPython plugin.
